# Pick-5 Lottery
Takes 5 values input by the user, and generates an array, to compare against an auto-generated winning array, and displays the matching numbers.

## Hypothetical Requirements
Program a pick-5 lottery game. Your program should have a separate function to generate and store 5 distinct winning numbers (NO DUPLICATES) between 1 and 9 (inclusive) into an array, and a separate function to determine if the current number is already in the array, and a main program.

The main program should:
     prompt the user to enter 5 distinct numbers between 1 and 9,
     store the numbers in an array,
     verify that the numbers entered by the user are distinct
            if numbers NOT distinct, allow the user to enter a new set of numbers until they enter 5 distinct numbers.
     After the user's choices are stored, the program then compares and determines whether the two arrays are identical. If the two arrays are identical, then the user wins the game; otherwise the program outputs the number of matching digits and the winning  numbers array.

Be sure to use appropriate prompt statements and informative output statements.

## Running this program
This program requires a C++ compiler to build/run. Code::Blocks is a decent IDE that runs on Windows.
